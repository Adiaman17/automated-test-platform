# automating-the-examination-system


Conducting examination and answer sheet evaluation are hectic testing tools for assessing academic achievement, 
integration of ideas and ability to recall, but are expensive, resource and time consuming.
Manual question generation and evaluation of answer sheet takes up a significant amount of valuable time and
resource making it an expensive process.
Automated examination, if proven to match or exceed the reliability of human evaluators,
will significantly reduce costs and time.
The purpose of this project is to build an automated examination system using machine learning,
natural language processing and web technologies to provide an inexpensive alternative
to the current examination system.
