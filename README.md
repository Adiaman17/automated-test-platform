# automating-the-examination-system

Conducting examination and answer sheet evaluation are hectic testing tools for assessing academic achievement, integration of ideas and ability to recall, but are expensive, resource and time consuming to generate question and evaluate response manually. Manual evaluating of answer sheet takes up a significant amount of instructors' valuable time, and hence is an expensive process. Automated examination, if proven to match or exceed the reliability of human evaluators, will significantly reduce costs. The purpose of this project is to build an automated examination system using machine learning, natural language processing and web technologies to provide an inexpensive alternative to the current examination system. These evaluations from the automatic examination system should match the human grades consistently.
